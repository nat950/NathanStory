There once was a man named John. He lived in Texas. He was a cattle rancher.

I'm liang. I just had a tired trip from my home to campus. I have to take train for 2 hrs, then take subway for 2 hrs. Then I had to take flight for 13 hrs, then take bus for 3 hrs. So I just want to have a nice sleep now.

Then one day John's cattle ran away during a storm, and Liang couldn't round themup because he was tired. Due to this the cattle ran rampant through the pastures and soon the cattle had scattered through the valley. John and Liang were at a
loss for what they should do.

Then John thought of a genius plan. He'd call up his other rancher buddies. He called them up and they arrived within no time. These guys were the best of the best and no cattle would be able to evade them. They got straight to work.

After searching for hours, they discovered pastures where the cattle were grazing. John thought it better to expand his land so the cows
would have room to roam. He acquired the pastures, and his cattle grew stronger and happier than ever.
