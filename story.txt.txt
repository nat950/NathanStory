There once was a man named John. He lived in Texas. He was a cattle rancher.

I'm liang. I just had a tired trip from my home to campus. I have to take train for 2 hrs, then take subway for 2 hrs. Then I had to take flight for 13 hrs, then take bus for 3 hrs. So I just want to have a nice sleep now.
